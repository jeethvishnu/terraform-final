data source
-------------
means if any change came in ami ids so the ids will change in a period of time instead of takin it manually we can use this concept.

going to console searching it and then using it..

quering and filtering aws
means in amazon after searching something we have filters right for brands,rates etc

in terraform we have AWS creds.

so it can query and fetch teh ami_id automatically.
