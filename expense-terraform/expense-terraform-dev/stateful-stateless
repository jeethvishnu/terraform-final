Stateful vs Stateless

*State == Storage

**MySQL data is stored== Stateful application
**Backend no storage for backend== Stateless application

**Frontend no storage for frontend == Stateless application.
**very difficult to retreive data from Stateful application.

**easy to restore backend applications because of no state.
